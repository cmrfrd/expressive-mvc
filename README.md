</p>

## Quick Start

<br />

> Install with preferred package manager
```bash
npm install --save use-stateful
```
<br />

> Import and use in your components

```js
import { useStateful } from "use-stateful";
```

<br/>

## What does it do?

Use stateful is a great alternative to having a bunch of `useState` calls within your components. A single `useStateful` hook can manage pretty much all the simple state in your component with one call.

In a nutshell, this hook grafts ‚ú®*live-state* ‚ú® onto some given state and returns it to your component through the hook. 

### ‚úåÔ∏èlive state ‚úåÔ∏è?

Basically it is a new object, inheriting (via prototype) from the one you passed into `useStateful`, with all of its "live values" (enumerable, non-methods) covered over by `setter` & `getter` pairs. It uses the given state object to set initial values and to know what setters are needed for tracking. The hook will then watch for updates to those values, compare them, and if they're different... trigger a render! üê∞üé©

<br/>

### Consider the following:

> Here is an example where we have multiple values to track. <br/>
> All the single-use variables can really add up, and they're not always easy to read or infer. 

```jsx
const EmotionalState = () => {
    const [name, setName] = useState("John Doe");
    const [emotion, setEmotion] = useState("meh");
    const [reason, setReason] = useState("reasons.");

    return (
        <div>
            <div onClick = {() => {
                const name = prompt("What is your name?", "John Doe");
                setName(name);
            }}>
                My name is {name}.
            </div>
            <div>
                <span onClick = {() => {
                    setName("sad");
                }}>
                    I am currently {emotion}
                </span>
                <span onClick = {() => {
                    setReason("hooks are still not hipster enough.")
                }}>
                    because {reason}
                </span>
            </div>
        </div>
    )
}
```
> This makes John Doe correspondingly sad, as you can see here.

<br/>

### How can we do better?

> Use the `useStateful` hook.

```jsx
const HappyTown = () => {
    const $ = useStateful(_ => ({
        name: "John Doe",
        emotion: "whatever",
        reason: "I dunno man."
    }));

    return (
        <div>
            <div onClick = {() => {
                $.name = prompt("What is your name?", "John Doe");
            }}>
                My name is {$.name}.
            </div>
            <div>
                <span onClick = {() => {
                    $.emotion = "super happy"
                }}>
                    I am currently {$.emotion} 
                </span>
                <span onClick = {() => {
                    $.reason = "hooks are cooler than my nitro ice-cold-brew¬Æ coffee! üëì"
                }}>
                    because {$.reason}
                </span>
            </div>
        </div>
    )
}
```

> Much better.

The hook's argument over there, its "*constructor*", will ***only run at mount***, and the returned object will then be bootstrapped into live state.

The component now updates when any of your declared values change. You can add as many values as you like, and they'll stay clean and relatively organized in your code.

> And now John Doe seems pretty mollified by this development.

<br/>

## Adding Methods

Similar to `@computed` and `@action` found in [MobX.js](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx), you can include `get`, `set`, and methods amongst your watched values. 

They'll reference your live state and work [generally as you'd expect](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat), with regards to `this` keyword.

All methods are **bound automatically**, so you can pass them as callbacks or to sub-components, and it'll work just fine.

<br/>

```jsx
const HiBob = () => {
    const $ = useStateful(_ => ({

        ownName: "Bob",
        friendsName: undefined,

        get standardHello(){
            return `Hey there, name's ${this.name}.`;
        },

        set friend(name){
            void name;
            //immediately forget;
            this.friendsName = "bro"
        },

        sayHi(){
            const whatsHisFace = this.friendsName;
            if(whatsHisFace){
                alert(`Oh hey ${whatsHisFace}, how's it uh hanging?`)
                return;
            }

            alert(this.standardHello);

            const whoIsThisGuy = prompt("Hey uuuhh...");

            if(whoIsThisGuy){
                alert(`Oh hey ${whoIsThisGuy}! Long time no see!!`);
                this.friendsName = whoIsThisGuy;
            }
            else 
                alert(`Heeeey, ...There..?`);
        }
        
    }));

    return <div onClick={$.sayHi}>Hi {$.ownName}</div>
}
```
<br/>

### Reserved methods

#### `refresh(): void`
- requests a re-render without requiring a value changed. 
- Helpful when working with getters.

#### `export(): { [P in keyof T]: T[P] }`
- generates a clone of the live state you can pass along without unintended mutations.
- this will only output the values which were enumerable in the source object.

#### `add(key: string, intital?: any): boolean`
- adds a new tracked value to the live-state. 
- this will return `true` if adding the key succeeded, `false` if did not. (because it exists)
> Not really recommended *after* initializing, but hey.

<br/>

## `useStateful` also accepts an object.

If you prefer to prepare your initial values on the outside of a component, you can do that too.<br/>
This is especially useful for situations with closures, or [HOC's](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html).

> *Just don't give `useStateful` an object literal.*<br/>
> *It will get regenerated every render!* 


```jsx
const defaults = {
    name: "Bob"
}   

const Component = () => {
    const $ = useStateful(defaults);

    return <div>Hello {$.name}</div>
}
```

Keep in mind updated values **are** stored on the given object. This can be helpful or a pain depending on the curcumstances. 

<br/>
<h2>It accepts a function too.</h2>

Well, you knew that, from the first example. However, what you may not have noticed is that `componentWillMount` comes ***FREE*** with `useStateful`.

**You heard right folks**, for the low-low price of this single hook, you dont need `useEffect` (with that ugly `[]` argument) after all!

<br/>


```jsx
const TimeFlys = () => {
    const $ = useStateful(_ => {

        setInterval(() => {
            $.duration++;
        }, 1000)

        return {
            duration: 0
        }
    });

    return <div>Time sure does fly, {$.duration} seconds has just gone by. üñã</div>
}
```

To boot, can use this space to declare all of your async opperations, listeners and computed defaults **and interact with them**. 

Thanks to the closure you can access `$` (or whatever you name it), ***but, only. through. functions***.

> Keep in mind that `$` doesn't actually exist until `useStateful` returns, but your event bodies should have no trouble scooping it out of the double-closure. Weird I know. üëÄüëå

<br/> 

### However, we're actually missing something here.

That `setInterval` over there should really be cleaned up when the component unmounts.

Let's fix that right up.

```jsx
const PaintDries = () => {

    //wish you had access to ComponentWillUnmount?
    //handle cleanup with ‚Üì     ‚Üì it adds an event listener!

    const $ = useStateful(unmount => {

        const stopwatch = 
            setInterval(() => {
                $.duration++;
            }, 1000)

        unmount(() => {
            clearInterval(stopwatch)
        })

        return {
            duration: 0
        }
    });

    return <div>Well there's {$.duration} seconds I'm never getting back...</div>
}
```


#### AddEventListener (for `componentWillUnmount`) to the rescue!

This callback captures a function, to be called when react notices your component is unmounting. 

***Note***: *This can only be set within the initializer function.*
> Effectively it's passed around to the return value of a `useEffect` hook that will run right after your initializer returns. One in the same, of the technique for simulating `componentWillUnmount` with hooks.
>
> I made it `_` in the earlier examples because I find that cleaner than empty parenthesis, visually speaking.

<br/>
<br/>

<h2>And, if can you believe it, it accepts functions as well!</h2>

#### (External ones this time)

It can be pretty useful to declare your state function itself, outside its respective component. That, or better yet, sharing logic between multiple components is possible with this approach. 

This gives you the space to construct fancy state machines with lots of events and async, without bloating your components.

> Instead of the closure var, you can use `this` again, to access live state.<br/>
> You couldn't before because of the keyword fowarding done by arrow-functions.

**Again however,** you cannot do anything to `this` within the function body, its only a weak reference until bootstrap finishes. 

> The setup process takes place only after this constructor has returned. `This` is here purely to use within closures of the function body.

<br/>

```jsx
function StickySituation(ohTheyRanAway){
    const deathTimer = setInterval(() => {
        const remains = --this.countdown
        if(remains == 0)
            cutTheDrama();
    }, 1000);

    const cutTheDrama = () => clearInterval(deathTimer);

    ohTheyRanAway(cutTheDrama)
    
    return {
        countdown: 5,
        surname: "Bond",
        async newAgent(_clickEvent){
            const recruit = await 
                fetch("https://randomuser.me/api/")
                .then(res => res.json())
                .then(data => data.results[0])

            this.surname = recruit.name.last;
        }
    }
}
```

Keeps the **M** and the **VC** nice and seperate.

```jsx
const ActionSequence = () => {
    const $ = useStateful(StickySituation);

    if($.countdown == 0)
        return <h1>üôÄüí•</h1>

    return (
        <div>
            <div>Agent <b>{$.surname}</b> we need you to diffuse the bomb!</div>
            <div>If you can't diffuse it in {$.countdown} seconds, the cat may or may not die!</div>
            <div>
                Be sure to <u onClick={$.newAgent}>tap another agent</u> if you think they can do it.
            </div>
        </div>
    )
}
```

### OK, but what if you like, *want* to use an arrow function.

You do you, fam.

```jsx
const OkSomeStateIGuess = (_, self) => {
    //are you happy now?
    ThinkAboutIt()
        .then(() => {
            self.opinion = "quite happy"
        })

    return {
        opinion: "ummm"
    }
}
```

> Actually, being honest, that earlier `HiBob` example would work pretty well formatted like this.
