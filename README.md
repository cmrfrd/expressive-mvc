# Quick Start

<br />

> Install with preferred package manager
```bash
npm install --save @gabeklein/use-controller
```
<br />

> Import and use in your react apps.

```js
import Controller, { use } from "@gabeklein/use-controller";
```

<br/>

## Live demo

<br/>

Try it for yourself. A demo project is in the `/examples` directory with a series of examples you can launch, browse through and modify.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gabeklein/use-controller.git
cd use-controller
npm install
npm start
```

<br/>

# What does this do?

There are two ways to use hooked-controllers, with the `use()` hook or by extending your control-classes with `Controller`. Both ways behave pretty much the same, albeit with different features.

What they both do is pretty simple. They a class and turn it into ‚ú®*live-state* ‚ú® for your components! But... what does that mean? 

> Here is a simple example.

```jsx
class Count {
  number = 1
}

const Counter = () => {
  const state = use(Count);

  return (
    <Container>
      <Button 
        onClick={() => { 
          state.number -= 1
        }}>
        {"-"}
      </Button>
      <Box>{state.number}</Box>
      <Button 
        onClick={() => { 
          state.number += 1
        }}>
        {"+"}
      </Button>
    </Container>
  )
}
```

> For sake of simplicity we are only using one value. You wouldn't typically do this.

Here we create a state controller, with the `use()` hook, passing in `Counter`. This will create a new instance of your class, then scan the resulting instance for values. On the returned state, `use()` will watch for changes in your values, compare updates, and if they're different... trigger a render! üê∞üé© No need for `setValue` callbacks, and you can have as many as you want!

<br/>

## Why do it this way? 


### A quick comparison

> Here is an example where we have multiple values to track. <br/>
> All the single-use variables can really add up, and they're not always easy to read or infer. 
> It's also a heck-ton of var pollution.

```jsx
const EmotionalState = () => {
  const [name, setName] = useState("John Doe");
  const [emotion, setEmotion] = useState("meh");
  const [reason, setReason] = useState("reasons.");

  return (
    <div>
      <div onClick = {() => {
        const name = prompt("What is your name?", name);
        setName(name);
      }}>
        My name is {name}.
      </div>
      <div>
        <span onClick = {() => {
          setName("sad");
        }}>
          I am currently {emotion}
        </span>
        <span onClick = {() => {
          setReason("hooks are still not hipster enough.")
        }}>
          because {reason}
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```
> This makes John Doe correspondingly sad, as you can see here.

<br/>

### How can we do better?

> Use a class and the `use()` hook.

```jsx
class EmotionalState {
  name = "John Doe",
  emotion = "whatever",
  reason = "I dunno man."
}

const HappyTown = () => {
  const state = use(EmotionalState);

  return (
    <div>
      <div onClick = {() => {
        state.name = prompt("What is your name?", "John Doe");
      }}>
        My name is {state.name}.
      </div>
      <div>
        <span onClick = {() => {
          state.emotion = "super happy"
        }}>
          I am currently {state.emotion} 
        </span>
        <span onClick = {() => {
          state.reason = "hooks are cooler than my cold-brew¬Æ coffee! üëì"
        }}>
          because {state.reason}
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

> A bit better.

The hook's argument over there, its *constructor*, will only run at mount, and the returned object will then be bootstrapped into live state.

The component now updates when any of your declared values change. You can add as many values as you like, and they'll stay clean and relatively organized in your code.

> And John Doe seems pretty mollified by this development now too.

<br/>

# Adding Methods

Similar to `@action` found in [MobX.js](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx), you can place methods amongst your watched values. 

They'll access your live state and work [generally as you'd expect](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat), with regards to `this` keyword.

All methods are bound automatically (both arrow and proto functions), so you can pass them to callbacks and sub-components.

<br/>

> Let's circle back to our counter example. We can make a few big improvements.


```jsx
class Count {
  current = 1

  increment = () => this.current++;
  decrement = () => this.current--;
}

const KitchenCounter = () => {
  const count = use(Count);

  return (
    <Row>
      <Button
        onClick={count.decrement}>
        {"-"}
      </Button>
      <Box>{count.current}</Box>
      <Button 
        onClick={count.incremement}>
        {"+"}
      </Button>
    </Row>
  )
}
```

> Nice! Now all logic is out of the component. All is well with the world üëå

# Special Entries

While standard practice is to take all methods (and bind them), all properties (and watch them), there are special circumstances to be aware of.

<br/>

## Properties

#### `Arrays`
- if a property is an array, it will be forwarded to your components as a `ReactiveArray` which triggers a render on mutate.

#### `_anything`
- if a key starts with an underscore it will not trigger a refresh when overwritten (or carry any overhead to do that). No special conversions will happen either. Think of those as "private" keys which don't interact with a component.

#### `Defined post-constructor`
- important to notice that `use()` can only detect properties which exist (and are enumerable) at time of creation. If you create them after, effectively they're ignored.

<br/>

## Reserved methods (`use` will define them)

#### `refresh(): void`
- requests a render without requiring that a value has changed. 
- Helpful when working with getters, async and random-number-generators.

#### `export<T>(this: T): { [P in keyof T]: T[P] }`
- takes a snapshot of live state you can pass along without unintended side effects.
- this will only output the values which were enumerable in the source object.

#### `add(key: string, initial?: any): boolean`
- adds a new tracked value to the live-state. 
- this will return `true` if adding the key succeeded, `false` if did not. (because it exists)
> Not really recommended after initializing, but hey.

<br/>

## LifeCycle Methods (`use` will call them)

#### `didMount(): void`
- `use()` will call this while internally running `useEffect(fn, [])`

#### `willUnmount(): void`
- `use()` will call this before it starts cleaning up


<br/>

### Let's take advantage of those lifestyle methods, shall we?

Here we'll spawn an interval on mount, which should also be cleaned up when the component unmounts.

```js
class FunActivity {
  duration = 0;

  didMount(){
    this._stopWatch = 
      setInterval(() => {
        this.duration++;
      }, 1000)
  }

  willUnmount(){
      clearInterval(this._stopWatch)
  }
}
```

```jsx
const PaintDrying = () => {
  const fun = use(FunActivity);

  return <div>Well there's {fun.duration} seconds I'm never getting back...</div>
}
```

<br/>
<br/>

# The `Controller` superclass

While we get a lot from just `use()` and standard (or otherwise extended) classes, there's a few key benefits from actually extending `Controller`.

- You can pass arguments to your constructor
- Type inference and autocomplete are much better
- extra lifecycles
- Access to context features üëÄ
- error boundaries

<br/>

### We can very easily translate our previous example and build up from there.


> Import "Controller" as whatever you like from `"@gabeklein/use-controller"` and extend your class with it.

```js
import Control from "@gabeklein/use-controller";

class FunActivity extends Control {
  duration = 0;

  didMount(){
    this._stopWatch = 
      setInterval(() => {
        this.duration++;
      }, 1000)
  }

  willUnmount(){
      clearInterval(this._stopWatch)
  }
}
```
> Instead of the `use()` hook, we now use the *all-new* `.use()` hook!

```jsx
const PaintDrying = () => {
  const fun = FunActivity.use();

  return (
    <div>
      <span>I've been staring for like </span>
      {fun.duration}
      <span> seconds and I'm starting to see what this is all about.</span>
    </div>
  )
}
```

> This will behave exactly as our previous example, however more appreciatively.

<br/>

### We can very easily translate our previous example and build from there.

```jsx
class StickySituation extends Control {
  remaining = 60;
  surname = "bond";

  didMount(){
    this._timer = 
      setInterval(() => {
        const remains = this.remaining -= 1
        if(remains == 0)
          cutTheDrama();
      }, 1000);
  }

  willUnmount(){
    this.cutTheDrama()
  }

  cutTheDrama(){
    clearInterval(this._timer);
  }

  getSombodyElse(){
    fetch("https://randomuser.me/api/")
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => data.results[0])
    .then(recruit => {
      this.surname = recruit.name.last
    })
  }
}
```

Keeping the **M**, **V**, and **C** nice and separate.

```jsx
const ActionSequence = () => {
  const agent = StickySituation.use();

  if(agent.remaining == 0)
    return <h1>üôÄüí•</h1>

  return (
    <div>
      <div>Agent <b>{agent.surname}</b> we need you to diffuse the bomb!</div>
      <div>
        If you can't diffuse it in {agent.remaining} seconds, the cat may or may not die!
      </div>
      <div>
        But there is time! 
        <u onClick={agent.getSombodyElse}>
          Tap another agent
        </u> 
        if you think they can do it.
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

<br/>

# Sidebar: `use()` also accepts an object

If you prefer to prepare your initial values, without anything fancy, you can do that too.<br/>
This can be especially useful for situations with closures or [HOC's](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html).

> *Just don't give `use()` an object literal.*<br/>
> *It will get regenerated every render!* 


```jsx
const values = {
  name: "Bob"
}   

const Component = () => {
  const state = use(values);

  return (
    <div
      onClick = {() => {
        state.name = "Robert"
      }}>
      Hello {state.name}
    </div>
  )
}
```

Keep in mind updated values are stored on the given object. This can be helpful but only in particular use cases.
