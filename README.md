<h2 id="overview-section">Overview</h2>

Seamlessly create and apply ES6 classes as a model [(of MVC fame)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model‚Äìview‚Äìcontroller) for [React function-components](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-function-component). The basic idea is pretty simple, to watch all properties in an instance of some class, and trigger a render wherever those changes might be visible. This is done with the help of [accessors (`get` & `set`)](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_accessors.asp) and `useReducer` behind the scenes.

For this, you have the general-purpose `use()` hook, which can apply any class, and `Controller`, an inheritable abstract-class with several more specialized hooks as its static methods.

When any of these hooks are called in a component, a reference to a controller is returned, bound to that mounted component. It contains current state, usable for rendering, while changes to that object are reflected by triggering a new render, where deemed necessary. 

This "live-state" combines with actions, computed properties, some lifecycle hooks, and the component itself to create what is effectively a model-view-controller.

<br/>

<h2 id="install-section">Installation</h2>

Install with your preferred package manager
```bash
npm install --save react-use-controller
```

Import and use in your react apps.

```js
import { use, Controller } from "react-use-controller";
```

> **Note:** `Controller` can also be imported as default

<br/>

<h1 id="started-section">Getting Started</h1>

There are two ways to use a controller, supply any class to the `use` hook or [extend one with `Controller`](#controller-section). <br/>
Both ways behave pretty much the same, though extending has some key benefits.

> It is generally recommended you extend but, for simple models, `use` is best for its brevity.

<br/>

<h2 id="concept-simple">Simplest use-case</h2>

Let's make a stateful counter.

```jsx
import { use } from "react-use-controller";

// Make a class with some properties. They will be tracked for updates. 
class CountControl {
  number = 1
}

const KitchenCounter = () => {
  /* Pass your class to use(); it will create and return a new instance, 
   * bound to your component's instance as its model or "state". */
  const state = use(CountControl);

  // Setting new values to its properties will trigger a render in order
  // to keep synced.     ‚åÑ               ‚åÑ
  return (
    <Row>
      <Button
        onClick={() => { state.number -= 1 }}>
        {"-"}
      </Button>
      <Box>{state.number}</Box>
      <Button 
        onClick={() => { state.number += 1 }}>
        {"+"}
      </Button>
    </Row>
  )
}
```

<br/>

<h2 id="concept-method">Adding methods</h2>

What's a view controller without its methods? Add some ["actions"](https://mobx.js.org/refguide/action.html) to easily abstract changes to your state.

```jsx
class CountControl {
  number = 1

  /* We can edit state directly using `this`.
   * Notice these are arrow functions, and thus bound. */
  increment = () => this.number++;
  decrement = () => this.number--;
}
```

```jsx
const KitchenCounter = () => {
  /* You can use destructuring too, */
  const { number, decrement, increment } = use(CountControl);

  // and pass bound callbacks directly from the controller
  //                   ‚åÑ       ‚åÑ
  return (
    <Row>
      <Button onClick={decrement}>{"-"}</Button>
      <Box>{number}</Box>
      <Button onClick={increment}>{"+"}</Button>
    </Row>
  )
}
```

<br/>

<h2 id="concept-lifecycle">Lifecycle methods</h2>

The `use()` hook will automatically call defined [lifecycle hooks](#lifecycle-list) when appropriate.
```jsx
import React from "react";

class TimerControl {
  elapsed = 1;

  /* Automatically called from an internal `useEffect()` */
  didMount(){
    this.timer = 
      setInterval(
        () => this.elapsed++, 
        1000
      )
  }

  willUnmount(){
    /* remember to cleanup too! */
    clearInterval(this.timer);
  }
}
```

```jsx
const KitchenTimer = () => {
  const state = use(TimerControl);

  return <Box>{state.elapsed}</Box>;
}
```

<!-- > Technically, this does also work with `use()`, but it's still recommended you extend your classes. <br/> 
> It's safer and more consistent, for anything but the simplest of controllers. -->

<br />

<h2 id="concept-destruct">Destructuring</h2>

While destructuring, with two reserved keys `get` and `set`, we can still retrieve and update values after doing so.

> Not to be confused with the keywords. As named properties both are the same, just a circular reference to `state`. Use whatever makes the most sense semantically.

```jsx
const AboutMe = () => {
  const {
    set, // ‚¨Ö a proxy for `state`
    name
  } = use(AboutYou);

  return (
    <div onClick = {() => {
      set.name = window.prompt("What is your name?", "John Doe");
    }}>
      My name is {name}.
    </div>
  )
}
```

> See what we did there? üòé

<br/>

<h2 id="concept-debounce">Automatic debouncing</h2>

Rest assured. Updates you make synchronously will be batched together as only one update.

```jsx
class ZeroStakesGame {
  foo = "bar"
  bar = "baz"
  baz = "foo"

  shuffle = () => {
    this.foo = "???"
    this.bar = "foo"
    this.baz = "bar"

    setTimeout(() => {
      this.foo = "baz"
    }, 1000)
  }
}

const MusicalChairs = () => {
  const { foo, bar, baz, shuffle } = use(ZeroStakesGame);

  <span>Foo is {foo}'s chair!</span>
  <span>Bar is {bar}'s chair!</span>
  <span>Baz is {baz}'s chair!</span>

  <div onClick={shuffle}>üé∂ü•Åüé∂üé∑üé∂</div>
}
```

> Even though we're ultimately making four updates, `use()` only needs to re-render twice. It does so once for everybody (being on the same tick), resets when finished, and again wakes for `foo` when settled all in.

<br/>

<h2 id="concept-lazy">Subscription based "lazy" updating</h2>

Controllers use a subscription model to decide when to render. Through automatic subscription, components will **only** update for changes to values which are accessed on the first render.

> Here `LazyComponent` will not update when `bar` does change, because it *seems* to only access `foo` here. 

```jsx
class FooBar {
  foo = "bar"
  bar = "foo"
}

const LazyComponent = () => {
  const { set, foo } = use(FooBar);

  return (
    <h1 
      onClick={() => set.bar = "baz" }>
      Foo is {foo} but click here to update bar!
    </h1>
  )
}
```

### Automatic inference 

Instances of a controller can figure out what to subscribe to automatically. They do it by spying on what's **accessed on the initial render** of a component they hook into.

> **Recommended**: While `use` cannot read your functions, destructuring by default is a useful way to get consistent behavior. If a property is not accessed on initial render render (being within an `if` statement or ternary), it could fail to update as expected.

<!-- ### Explicit subscription

There are also a number of helper methods you can call to specify which properties you wish to watch. <br/>
Check them out in [Subscription API](#subscription-api) section. -->

<br/>

<h1 id="controller-section">The <code>Controller</code> superclass</h1>

While you get a lot from `use()` and standard (or otherwise extended) classes, there are a few key benefits to extending `Controller`.

- You can pass arguments to the constructor
- Type are maintained, making inference a lot better
- Explicit subscription based rendering
- Ability to create a `Provider`, making state accessible anywhere.
- An optional error-boundary with the use of a provider.

<br/>

> To hook this way, rather than passing a class into `use`, extend `Controller` and call the attached `.use()` method.

```jsx
import Controller from "react-use-controller"

class Control extends Controller {
  value = 1;
}
```
```jsx
const Component = () => {
  const { value } = Control.use();

  return <div>{value}</div>;
}
```
> `.use` will hook to your component and construct state only once per mount, same as a standard `use` would.

<br/>

<h2 id="concept-constructor">Passing arguments to your constructor</h2>

Method `use(...)` will pass its own arguments to the constructor while creating a new instance. 

```typescript
/* typescript */

class Control extends Controller {
  value: number;

  constructor(props: MyComponentProps){
    this.value = props.startWith;
  }
}
```
```jsx
const MyComponent = (props) => {
  const { value } = Control.use(props);

  return <div>{value}</div>;
}
```

<br/>

<h2 id="concept-context">Access state anywhere <sup>(with context)</sup></h2>

One of the best features of `Controller` classes is [using Context](https://frontarm.com/james-k-nelson/usecontext-react-hook/), to create and consume the same state from anywhere in your app. 

Of the available static methods, `.create()` will produce a [Provider](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#contextprovider) to wrap child-components with. Components nested can call the static-method `.get()` on the same constructor to access the nearest instance of that class.

Thanks to [lazy-updating](#lazy-concept), only properties used by a consumer will trigger render for that component. Plus, actions are made available anywhere in your hierarchy, letting distant components cleanly "update" each other through a shared controller.

<br/>

```jsx
export class Central extends Controller {
  foo = 0;
  bar = 0;

  fooUp = () => this.foo++ 
  barUp = () => this.bar++ 
};

export const App = () => {
  /* An alternative to use(), create() will directly return a <Provider> with a new live-state. 
   * If you want values too, you can access { Provider } from .use() as well. */
  const Control = Central.create();

  return (
    <Control>
      <InnerFoo/>
      <InnerBar/>
    </Control>
  )
}
```

```jsx
const InnerFoo = () => {
  /* .get, rather than making a new `Central` controller, 
   * will return the nearest one (in this case from `App`). */
  const { fooUp, bar } = Central.get();

  return (
    <div onClick={fooUp}>
      <pre>Foo</pre>
      <small>Bar was clicked {bar} times!</small>
    </div>
  )
}
```

```jsx
const InnerBar = () => {
  /* Controller knows this component needs to update only when foo changes.
   * Lazy refreshing ensures only properties accessed on initial render are watched here. */
  const { barUp, foo } = Central.get();

  return (
    <div onClick={barUp}>
      <pre>Bar</pre> 
      <small>Foo was clicked {foo} times!</small>
    </div>
  )
}
```

> This makes context kind of easy a little bit.

<br/>

<h2 id="concept-typescript">Using with typescript</h2>

Importing and extending `default` (`Controller`), as whatever you like, will allow type definitions to pass to your controllers definitions. This gives you autocomplete, hints, and warns about potential errors.<br/>

> For class `T` the static method `.use()` returns `InstanceType<T>` thus provides full type inference within the component too.

```tsx
/* typescript */

import Control from "react-use-controller";

class FunActivity extends Control {
  secondsSofar: number;
  interval: number;

  constructor(alreadyMinutes: number = 0){
    this.secondsSofar = 
      alreadyMinutes * 60;

    this.interval = 
      setInterval(() => {
        this.secondsSofar++;
      }, 1000)
  }

  /* JSDocs on the Controller class will also provide descriptors and 
   * autocomplete, making it easier to avoid weird behavior over typos. */
  willUnmount(){
    clearInterval(this.interval)
  }
}
```

```jsx
const PaintDrying = ({ alreadyMinutes }) => {
  /* Your IDE will know secondsSofar is supposed to be a number üëå */
  const { secondsSofar } = FunActivity.use(alreadyMinutes);

  return (
    <div>
      I've been staring for like, { secondsSofar } seconds now, 
      and I'm starting to see what this is all about! üëÄ
    </div>
  )
}
```

<br/>
<br/>

### (Besides all that)
<h1 id="compare-section">How is this better than regular hooks?</h1>

Here is an example where we have multiple values to track, showing the main rational. <br/>

```jsx
const EmotionalState = () => {
  const [name, setName] = useState("John Doe");
  const [emotion, setEmotion] = useState("meh");
  const [reason, setReason] = useState("reasons.");

  return (
    <div>
      <div onClick = {() => {
        const name = prompt("What is your name?", name);
        setName(name);
      }}>
        My name is {name}.
      </div>
      <div>
        <span onClick = {() => {
          setEmotion("sad");
        }}>
          I am currently {emotion}
        </span>
        <span onClick = {() => {
          setReason("hooks are still not hipster enough.")
        }}>
          , because {reason}.
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```
> Here is heck-ton of vars, inherently hard to scale or modify.

### And how can we fix that?

Simple, make a class containing state (*the Model*) and supply it to the `use()` hook.

```jsx
class EmotionalState {
  name = "John Doe"
  emotion = "meh"
  reason = "reasons"
}

const HappyTown = () => {
  const state = use(EmotionalState);

  return (
    <div>
      <div onClick = {() => {
        state.name = prompt("What is your name?", "John Doe");
      }}>
        My name is {state.name}.
      </div>
      <div>
        <span onClick = {() => {
          state.emotion = "doing better"
        }}>
          I am currently {state.emotion} 
        </span>
        <span onClick = {() => {
          state.reason = "hooks are cooler than my cold-brew coffee! üëì"
        }}>
          , because {state.reason}.
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

> With a controller, we can do a lot better on scope. Plus in an [MVC](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/mvc/mvc-architecture) sense, we've removed our Model (data) out of the View (component) which is nice.

Add as many values as you like, and they'll stay clean and _relatively_ organized in your code. (You still need good design!)

<br/>

## Work seamlessly with events, callbacks, and `async`

```jsx
class StickySituation extends Control {
  remaining = 60;
  surname = "bond";

  didMount(){
    this.timer = 
      setInterval(() => {
        const remains = this.remaining -= 1
        if(remains == 0)
          cutTheDrama();
      }, 1000);
  }

  willUnmount(){
    this.cutTheDrama()
  }

  cutTheDrama(){
    clearInterval(this.timer);
  }

  getSomebodyElse = async () => {
    const res = await fetch("https://randomuser.me/api/");
    const data = await res.json();
    const recruit = data.results[0];

    this.surname = recruit.name.last;
  }
}
```

```jsx
const ActionSequence = () => {
  const { remaining, surname, getSomebodyElse } = StickySituation.use();

  if(remaining == 0)
    return <h1>üôÄüí•</h1>

  return (
    <div>
      <div>Agent <b>{surname}</b> we need you to diffuse the bomb!</div>
      <div>
        If you can't diffuse it in {remaining} seconds, the cat may or may not die!
      </div>
      <div>
        But there is time! 
        <u onClick={getSomebodyElse}>
          Tap another agent
        </u> 
        if you think they can do it.
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

<br/>

<h1 id="property-api">Property API</h1>

Set behavior for certain methods on classes consumed by `use()` or extending `Controller`.

While standard practice is for `use` to take all methods (and bind them), all properties (and watch them), there are special circumstances to be aware of. <br /><br />


### Properties

#### `set` & `get`
- Not to be confused with setters / getters.
- `state.set` returns a circular reference to `state`
- this is useful to access your state object when destructuring

#### `Arrays`
- if a property is an array, it will be forwarded to your components as a special `ReactiveArray` which can also trigger a render on mutate.


#### `_anything`
- if a key starts with an underscore it will not trigger a refresh when overwritten (or carry any overhead to do so). No special conversions will happen. It's a shorthand for "private" keys which don't interact with the component.

#### `Anything defined post-constructor`
- important to notice that `use()` can only detect properties which exist (and are enumerable) at time of creation. If you create them after, they're effectively ignored.

<br />

### Reserved methods (`use` will define them)

#### `refresh(): void`
- requests a render without requiring that a value has changed. 
- Helpful when working with getters, async and random-number-generators.

#### `export<T>(this: T): { [P in keyof T]: T[P] }`
- takes a snapshot of live state you can pass along, without unintended side effects.
- this will only output the values which were enumerable in the source object.

#### `add(key: string, value?: any): boolean`
- adds a new tracked value to the live-state. 
- this will return `true` if adding the key succeeded, `false` if did not (because it exists).
- setting value is optional, if absent, `key` simply begins watching.
> Not really recommended after initializing, but can come in handy.

<br />

<h3 id="lifecycle-list">LifeCycle Methods (<code>use</code> will call them)</h3>

#### `didMount(): void`
- `use()` will call this while internally running `useEffect(fn, [])` for itself.

#### `willUnmount(): void`
- `use()` will call this before starting to clean up.

#### `didHook(): void`
- Called every render. A way to pipe in data from other hooks.

#### `willHook(): void`
- Called every render. However `this` references actual state only on first render. <br/>
  Useful for grabbing data without re-evaluating a property every render. (e.g. `useContext`)

<br/> 

<h1 id="subscribe-api">Subscription API</h1>

Chain after `use(...)` or your class to control what values explicitly will trigger a new render if-changed.

> if you have constructor arguments chain after `use(...)` or `get()`, <br />
> if not you can also call a `"useX"` / `"getX"` for brevity.

<br/>

#### `.use().once()` / `.useOnce()`

Will disable all but explicit `.refresh()` from this particular controller.

```js
const View = () => {
  const { foo, bar } = Controller.useOnce("bar");

  return false;
}
```
> This generates state, but never automatically updates.

<br/>

#### `.use().on()` / `.useOn()`

Declare properties you want to do want to watch, in addition to any inferred properties.

```js
const View = (props) => {
  const state = Controller.use(props).on("bar");

  return state.foo && (
    <span>{state.bar}</span>
  );
}
```
> This will refresh when either `foo` or `bar` change, even if `foo` starts out false.

<br/>

#### `.use().only()` / `.useOnly()`

Declare the properties you wish to renew for. This will skip automatic inference.

```js
const View = () => {
  const control = Controller.useOnly("foo", "bar");
  // ...
}
```

<br/>

#### `.use().not()` / `.useExcept()`

Declare properties you want to exclude. *May also be chained with `on()`*

```js
const View = () => {
  const { foo, bar } = Controller.useExcept("bar");

  return <span>{foo}</span>;
}
```
> This will only update when `foo` is updated, even though `bar` is definitely accessed.

<br/>
